The task involves developing a data pipeline and its underlying infrastructure. In order to complete the following user story sample data sources will be provided.


### User story:

we would like to explore and process the flights data in order to answer questions such as:
- how many days does the flights table cover ?
- how many departure cities the flight database covers ?
- what is the relationship between flights and planes tables ?
- which airplane manufacturer incurred the most delays in the analysis period ?
- what are the two most connected cities?


### The input data sources are comprised of (csv files in data.tar.gz):

- airlines
- airports
- flights
- planes
- weather


### Output:
- Please provide the solution in a git repository
- Write functions to get the answer the above user story questions
- Write unit and integration tests for most of the functions you write
- the data is kept small for the exercise, what considerations can be made when dealing with real data.
- what considerations can be made to promote this work to production.
- What CI/CD process will you use to speed up development lifecycle?
